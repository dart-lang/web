## 0.4.0

- Remove `implements JSObject` from all types. This is needed to move the JS
types exposed in `dart:js_interop` to extension types. This subtyping will be
added back in a future version when we move all `package:web` types to extension
types.

## 0.3.1-dev

- Add `onMessage` getter to `WindowEventGetters` extension methods.
- `helpers.dart`: expose the `EventStreamProviders` class.
- Add `createIFrameElement` method to `helpers.dart`.
- Updated types to account for union types.
- Fixed issue where all `JSAny`s were treated as nullable.
- Changed `JSVoid` to `void`.
- `interface mixin`s are no longer emitted as interfaces. Their members are
instead added to the interface that mixes them in.

## 0.3.0

- Updated source IDL to `v3.39.1`.
- Fixed a bug where `typedef`s were not declared with the IDL type's
  nullability.
- Types that were aliased to `double` are now aliased to `num`. This is to make
  it easier for users to pass integer values without going through a cast and to
  make migration from `dart:html` easier.

## 0.2.2-beta

- Updates SDK version minimum to 3.2.0-194.0.dev.
- Removes `isInstanceOfDomType` as `dart:js_interop` now exposes
  `instanceOfString`.

## 1.0.0

- Added supertypes' fields to dictionary constructors as dictionaries are
  allowed to contain those fields.
- Empty dictionary constructors now create an empty object instead of being
  treated like non-object literal `external` constructors.
- Generate MDN API documentation for getters.
- Update the docs for generated interface types to reference the MDN Web Docs
  project.
- Address several broken links in API documentation.
- Generate APIs based on if they're on track to be a standard and not
  experimental. This is a looser restriction from the previous requirement that
  APIs need to be implemented by Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. As part of this,
  dictionaries and typedefs are only emitted if they're used by a generated API.
- Added `onUnload` event stream to `ElementEventGetters` extension methods.
- Expose `ElementStream` as a public class.
- Require Dart `^3.4.0`.
- APIs that return a double value now return `double` instead of `num`. This is
  to avoid users accidentally downcasting `num`, which has different semantics
  depending on whether you compile to JS or Wasm. See issue [#57][] for more
  details.
- Fix an issue where some union types didn't account for typedef nullability.

## 0.5.1

- Add [`TrustedTypes`](https://web.dev/trusted-types) members.
- Include MDN API documentation as class and member dartdoc comments. Docs
  sourced from the [MDN Web Docs][] project; attributions and copyright
  licensing by Mozilla Contributors is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 2.5][].
- Add a constructor for each Element tag onto their respective Element
  interfaces.
- Remove `external` Element constructors that would result in a runtime error.
- Deprecate `createAudioElement` in favor of the `HTMLAudioElement` constructor.

## 0.5.0

- Redeprecate APIs that were deprecated in `0.4.1` but undeprecated in `0.4.2`.
- Add support for `dart fix` migrations from `dart:html` classes to
  `package:web` classes.
- Contribute a markdown file for the renamed classes from `dart:html` to
  `package:web` (see [renames.md](tool/renames.md)).
- Migrate classes to use interop extension types that implement `JSObject`.
- Add generics to APIs that use `JSArray` and `JSPromise`. Typedefs of a Dart
  primitive type are instead replaced with their JS type equivalent if they
  appear as a type parameter in order to conform with the type bounds of
  `JSArray` and `JSPromise`.
- Changed `record` types to be `JSObject` instead of `JSAny`.
- Reduce the number of DOM APIs we generate code for. Currently, the API needs
  to be standards-track, and be supported by Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
- Updated the source IDL version to `3.43.1`.
- Deprecate a few type aliases in favor of their standardized versions:

  | Deprecated            | Preferred               |
  | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
  | `AudioElement`        | `HTMLAudioElement`      |
  | `HtmlElement`         | `HTMLElement`           |
  | `CanvasElement`       | `HTMLCanvasElement`     |
  | `ImageElement`        | `HTMLImageElement`      |
  | `VideoElement`        | `HTMLVideoElement`      |
  | `CssStyleDeclaration` | `CSSStyleDeclaration`   |
  | `ContextEvent`        | `WebGLContextEvent`     |
  | `WebGL`               | `WebGLRenderingContext` |

- Deprecate the top-level `createElementTag`, `createCanvasElement`,
  `createIFrameElement`, and `querySelector` functions.
  Instead, use the standard creation and query methods on `document`.
- Deprecate the `client` extension methods on `MouseEvent` and `Touch`.
  Instead, directly use the `clientX` and `clientY` properties.
- Deprecate the `HttpRequest` API borrowed from `dart:html`.
  Consider migrating to `package:http` instead.

## 0.4.2

- Undeprecate some APIs and helpers library that were deprecated in `0.4.1`.
  Because deprecations are breaking in Flutter, they should be done in a
  breaking change.

## 0.4.1

- Exported the helper libraries from `web.dart`.
- Deprecated the `helpers.dart` library in favor of `web.dart`.
- Updated the readme to include usage info and package status.
- Added an example.
- Added event extensions for `WebSocket`
- Fixes to the return types of the `append()` and `clone()` extension methods on
  `Node`.
- Deprecated `NodeGlue.append` in favor of `Node.appendChild`.
- Deprecated `NodeGlue.clone` in favor of `Node.cloneNode`.
- Updated `@webref/css` to `6.10.0`.

## 0.4.0

- Remove `implements JSObject` from all types. This is needed to move the JS
  types exposed in `dart:js_interop` to extension types. This subtyping will be
  added back in a future version when we move all `package:web` types to extension
  types.
- Add `onMessage` getter to `WindowEventGetters` extension methods.
- `helpers.dart`: expose the `EventStreamProviders` class.
- Add `createIFrameElement` method to `helpers.dart`.
- Updated types to account for union types.
- Fixed issue where all `JSAny`s were treated as nullable.
- Changed `JSVoid` to `void`.
- `interface mixin`s are no longer emitted as interfaces. Their members are
  instead added to the interface that mixes them in.

## 0.3.0

- Updated source IDL to `v3.39.1`.
- Fixed a bug where `typedef`s were not declared with the IDL type's
  nullability.
- Types that were aliased to `double` are now aliased to `num`. This is to make
  it easier for users to pass integer values without going through a cast and to
  make migration from `dart:html` easier.

## 0.2.2-beta

- Updates SDK version minimum to 3.2.0-194.0.dev.
- Removes `isInstanceOfDomType` as `dart:js_interop` now exposes
  `instanceOfString`.

## 0.2.1-beta

- `helpers.dart`
  - Expose `EventStreamProvider`

## 0.2.0-beta

- Added `helpers.dart` top-level library.
- Require Dart 3.2 pre-release.
- Update to IDL 3.38.2

## 0.1.4-beta

- Support `bool`, `int`, `double`, `String` in APIs.

## 0.1.3-beta

- CSS properties can now be accessed directly.

## 0.1.2-beta

- `JSAny` as an IDL type now includes `null`.

## 0.1.1-beta

- Objects now inherit from JSObject.

## 0.1.0-beta

- First release.

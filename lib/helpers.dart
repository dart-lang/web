/// Main entry library for `package:web` helper layer.
///
/// The helper layer is a collection of libraries with extensions and methods
/// that bring functionality to `package:web` that many Dart developers are used
/// to have from `dart:html`.
///
/// This helper layer serves two purposes:
///   * provide useful functionality in environments where `dart:html` is not
///     available (like on Wasm).
///   * help bridge the gap in functionality from the past, which may reduce
///     the burden of migrating from code that previously used `dart:html`.
///
/// The main reason this functionality is provided on the side, is that some of
/// the functionality is expensive, and not always the right match for every
/// developer. Unlike `dart:html`, each developer needs to make a choice for
/// whether to consume some of the APIs provided here.
///
/// The libraries in this helper layer can also be consumed piece by piece.

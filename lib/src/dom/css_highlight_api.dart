  /// CSS property, the browser needs to decide which color should be used for
  /// styling the text in the overlapping part.

  /// the most recently registered highlight to style the overlapping parts.

  /// change this default behavior and determine which highlight's styles should
  /// be used to resolve style conflicts in overlapping parts.

  /// Note that all the styles of a highlight are applied and the browser only
  /// needs to resolve conflicts when the same CSS properties are used by

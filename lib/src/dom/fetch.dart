/// These actions include retrieving, setting, adding to, and removing headers

///
/// A `Headers` object has an associated header list, which is initially empty
/// and consists of zero or more name and value pairs. You can add to this using

/// this interface, header names are matched by case-insensitive byte sequence.

/// For security reasons, some headers can only be controlled by the user agent.
/// These headers include the  and .
///
/// A Headers object also has an associated guard, which takes a value of
/// `immutable`, `request`, `request-no-cors`, `response`, or `none`. This
/// affects whether the [Headers.set], [Headers.delete], and [Headers.append]
/// methods will mutate the header. For more information see .
///
/// You can retrieve a `Headers` object via the [Request.headers] and
/// [Response.headers] properties, and create a new `Headers` object using the
/// [Headers.Headers] constructor.
///
/// An object implementing `Headers` can directly be used in a `for...of`
/// structure, instead of [Headers.entries]: `for (const p of myHeaders)` is

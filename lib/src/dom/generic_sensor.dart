/// The **`Sensor`** interface of the
/// [Sensor APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Sensor_APIs)
/// is the base class for all the other sensor interfaces. This interface cannot
/// be used directly. Instead it provides properties, event handlers, and
/// methods accessed by interfaces that inherit from it.
///
/// This feature may be blocked by a
/// [Permissions Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy)
/// set on your server.
///
/// When initially created, the `Sensor` object is _idle_, meaning it does not
/// take measures. Once the [Sensor.start] method is called, it prepares itself
/// to read data and, once ready, the [Sensor.activate_event] event is sent and
/// the sensor becomes _activated_. It then sends a [Sensor.reading_event] event
/// each time new data is available.
///
/// In case of an error, the [Sensor.error_event] event is sent, reading stops,
/// and the `Sensor` object becomes _idle_ again. The [Sensor.start] method
/// needs to be called again before it can read further data.

/// that represents the body of a Content Security Policy (CSP) violation
/// report.
///
/// CSP violations are thrown when the webpage attempts to load a resource that
/// violates the policy set by the  HTTP header.
///
/// CSP violation reports are returned in the
/// [reports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReportingObserver/ReportingObserver#reports)
/// parameter of [ReportingObserver] callbacks that have a `type` of
/// `"csp-violation"`.
/// The `body` property of those reports is an instance of
/// `CSPViolationReportBody`.
///
/// CSP violation reports may also be sent as JSON objects to the endpoint
/// specified in the
/// [`report-to`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-to)
/// policy directive of the  header.
/// These reports similarly have a `type` of `"csp-violation"`, and a `body`
/// property containing a serialization of an instance of this interface.

/// > CSP violation reports sent by the Reporting API, when an endpoint is
/// > specified using the CSP
/// > [`report-to`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-to)
